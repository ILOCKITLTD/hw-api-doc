## 🚀 Endpoints & Data Formats

### 1. **Sync** 🔄
**Endpoint:** `POST /sync`

#### 📥 Request Data Format
```json
{
  "lockerId": "uniqueSerial",
  "compartments": [
    {"size": 0, "position": 1},
    {"size": 0, "position": 2}
  ]
}
```

#### 📤 Example with Active Session
If a compartment (e.g., position 1) has an active session:
```json
{
  "lockerId": "uniqueSerial",
  "compartments": [
    {
      "size": 0,
      "position": 1,
      "session": {
        "phone": "0700824555",
        "start": "1736263096525",
        "end": "-",
        "duration": "-"
      }
    },
    {"size": 0, "position": 2}
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Bill** 💸
**Endpoint:** `POST /bill`

#### 📥 Request Data Format
```json
{
  "lockerId": "uniqueSerial",
  "compartment": 3,
  "phone": "0700824555",
  "start": "1736263096525",
  "end": "1736263096525",
  "duration": "120"
}
```

#### 🛠️ Behavior After Request
- After the bill is sent, the server will send an SMS, and the session should end.
- To end the session, the API will send a payload to open the compartment:
  ```json
  {"open": 3}
  ```
- **Note:** If you receive `{"open": 3}` but no bill was sent for the compartment, just open the compartment without ending its session.
